#Lulea Facebook Data Center

The Facebook data center in Lulea , Sweden was the [first](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/facebook/facebook-data-center-investment-sweden-nears-us1b) data center that the 
company built in Europe. While it is currently two separate buildings, a third
is being added to the tune of [$1 billion and 540,000 extra square footage](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/facebook/facebook-data-center-investment-sweden-nears-us1b). The
plant is powered by hydroelectricity, and the excess heat generated by the plant
is used to maintain temperatures inside the office if it is cold out. In 2015,
this data center was considered the ["the most energy efficient computing 
facility ever built"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/25/facebook-datacentre-lulea-sweden-node-pole). In Lulea, electricity costs 0.2298 Euro per kWh. Given 
that the plant runs on 337000 kW a year, this puts their cost at around 
$74 million a year, with carbon emissions totalling [7000](https://sustainability.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2018-Sustainability-Data-Disclosure.pdf) tons of CO2 per year; 
roughly the same as 1500 cars driving around. 

#Recycling Energy
Industrial processes are never 100% efficient, and therefore energy is wasted in
the act of making any material good. Fortunately, there are ways to recoup this
energy and reuse it for something else. Examples of wasted energy can be sound 
or heat. While there isn't much you can do to harness sound waves into reusable
energy, heat itself can be stored in materials like water or glycol for later 
use. It is even possible to use the excess heat of a process to boil water, in
turn creating steam, which can ultimately spin a turbine and produce electricity.

#Indiana and Renewable Energy
Driving north on I-65 will show you one of Indiana's biggest initiatives for
renewable energy: a massive wind farm as far as the eye can see. Thanks to this
and other smaller renewable sources (geothermal, solar), [Indiana power companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2019/07/02/mike-pences-indiana-chooses-renewables-over-gas-as-it-retires-coal-early/#593c9b7243b4)
are starting to shut down their coal plants in favor of buying renewable energy,
in an attempt to get out of the coal game entirely. Despite Indiana's 
conservative stance on most things, it is clear that there is still a drive 
towards green energy in this beautiful state.

#Data Center Outage Example
In July 2018, multiple [google cloud services](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/cloud-networking/18012) experienced an outage that affected
87% of the users of the related services for a solid 32 minutes. This affected
popular services like Spotify, Snapchat, and even Pokemon Go! Google was forced
to pay reparations to customers who lost service, although the real amount is 
not known, but the average data center outage has been seen to cost a company
around [$750,000](https://gcn.com/Articles/2016/02/09/data-center-outages.aspx).
