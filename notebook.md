  -When we setup a cloud interface we want a blank slate of installed modules. We do not want
  pandas and matplotlib and numpy and a thousand others having to be loaded every time we 
  want to log into the cloud as this would waste resources. As such, we setup our own fresh
  virtual environment in order to make sure we only have what we want in there.
